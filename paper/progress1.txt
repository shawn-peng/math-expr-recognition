DATA:

1. We find three types of data: numbers, English letters and mathmatical symbols.
    * for numbers, we use mnist data:
        * Mnist data can be download directly from the website without polishing too much.
    * for English letters, we find Chars74K(English Hand writting) data:
        * We have not work on this data yet.
    * For mathmatical symbols, we use detexify data:
        * We made serveral scripts to transform detexify data to fit caffe.
        * convert stroke(svg) to png; we made the stroke bold which turned out a better result
        * composited the color of the image
        * resized image to 28x28 (this number is taken from mnist)
        * saved images into lmdb


Deep Leaning Framework:

1. We tried torch, theano and caffe. For torch, both of us were not familiar with Lua so we did not choose it. Theano is written in pure python and focus on fundamental deep learning mathmatic while caffe has higher level of abstraction so we decided to use caffe.
2. Built up envioronment to run Caffe.

Some Results:

1. We mainly use LeNet to do classification.
2. We pick 10 symbols from detexify data and so far get 86.77% correct rate.
3. Before bold the stroke, we can only get around 60% correct rate.

Future Planing:
1. Try to segmentation (split the math formula, maybe have not time for this one, we may focus on neural network)
2. Try to extend the number of classes to 100+
3. Analyse caffe lmdb database datastruct because we need to add our data to it
